# Mint the tokens you have created using SHYFT APIs

IN the previous sample project we have illustrated how to create your own Fungible token. In his sample project, we will illustrate how we can mint or transfer more units of our own fungible token using SHYFT APIs. 

## Things Needed to run this project

You need your wallets private key, the public key of the person you are transferring the units, and shyft's X-API-KEY (for header), a fancy name for the Fungible token you want to create and an icon for the token.

`Note: X-API-KEY is required to run this project which you can obtain your own on the shyft website(link below) by simply signing up with your email`

You can get your own API Key [here](https://shyft.to/get-api-key)
